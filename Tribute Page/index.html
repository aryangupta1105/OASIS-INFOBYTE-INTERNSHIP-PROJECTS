                        <h2>Inventions and Creations</h2>
                        <p>In 1989, while working as a software engineer at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, Berners-Lee conceived the idea of a global information-sharing system. His vision was to create a network that would allow scientists from around the world to easily share and access research documents and data. Drawing on his expertise in computer science and his deep understanding of hypertext systems, Berners-Lee proposed what would later become known as the World Wide Web.

                        <h2>Development and Key Technologies</h2>
                        <p> Berners-Lee's vision for the World Wide Web was realized through the development of several key technologies. He designed the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which governs how information is transmitted over the Web, and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard language for creating web pages. Additionally, Berners-Lee created the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), now known as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which provides a unique address for each resource on the Web. These foundational technologies laid the groundwork for the exponential growth and expansion of the Internet as we know it today.
